# Rock-paper-scissorgame-using-java
We all played the interesting game of rock, paper, scissors in our childhood. But have
you ever thought that one day you will learn to code the same game?Our project is all
about Rock Paper scissors game ,we will explain how to implement Rock, Paper,
Scissors Game in Java.
What is the Rock, Papers, Scissors
It is a two-player game where both simultaneously choose their move out of available
moves i.e. rock, paper, and scissors. Based on their moves and rules, the winner is
decided. The rules are that Rock beats scissors but loses to paper, Paper beats rock
but loses to scissors, and Scissors beats paper but loses to rock.Rock-Paper-Scissors
is a classic hand game played between two players, typically referred to as Player 1 and
Player 2. The game has three possible outcomes: a player wins, the other player wins,
or it's a tie.Rock-Paper-Scissors may seem like a simple game, but it holds significance
in various contexts, both recreational and educational.
Overall, while Rock-Paper-Scissors may appear to be a simple game on the surface, its
importance lies in its versatility, accessibility, and ability to teach valuable lessons in
probability, strategy, and social interaction. Whether played for fun or used as a teaching
tool, Rock-Paper-Scissors remains a timeless and beloved game with enduring appeal.
In this Java program, we'll implement a simple version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors
game where the player competes against the computer. The computer randomly selects
one of the three possible moves (rock, paper, or scissors), and the player chooses their
move. The program then determines the winner based on the rules of the game: rock
beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
Features of the Rock-Paper-Scissors Program:
● User Interaction: The program interacts with the user through the console,
prompting them to input their move for each round.
● Randomized Computer Move: The computer generates a random move (rock,
paper, or scissors) for each round using the `Random` class in Java.
● Outcome Determination: The program compares the player's move with the
computer's move to determine the winner of each round. It then displays the
result of the round (win, lose, or draw).

ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME 2
● Modular Design: The program is structured into methods for better organization
and readability. Each method handles a specific aspect of the game, such as
playing a single round or determining the winner.
● Customizable Rounds: The user can specify the number of rounds they want to
play at the beginning of the game, providing flexibility and control over the
gameplay experience.
How to Play:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of rounds you want to play.
3. For each round, enter your move (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.
4. The computer will randomly select its move.
5. The program will display the result of the round (win, lose, or draw).
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each round until the specified number of rounds is
completed.
7. At the end of the game, the program will display the overall winner based on the
number of rounds won by the player and the computer.
With this Rock-Paper-Scissors program, you can enjoy a classic game of strategy and
chance right from your Java console. Let's dive into the code and see how it works!
